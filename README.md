# CS210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  
  For this assignment, I had to create a program that allowed one to see how much their investments would grow over time.  The program took into account an initial investment amount, a monthly deposit, the annual interest rate, and the number of years for the investment's growth.  The program also showed the difference in investment growth if a monthly deposit wasn't made.

#What did you do particularly well?
  
  I believe I did a good job defining the Bank class.  As I was doing this assignment, I recalled working with Java and remembering how classes and objects were defined.  I was able to use that prior knowledge and tie it together with C++.  It led to a much easier process.  My class has all of the needed get and set functions and the private variables are properly named.  I think anyone looking into my class files can easily understand what each of the functions and variables represent.  While I have a lot of comments in my code, I think that helps anyone looking into my code to understand what each thing does.  I know it helped me stay focused as I was in the process of working on it.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  
  I think I could enhance some of the coding in my source file.  One of the things I struggled with was when it came to the white space of my final product.  With my current code, if I search for anything over 10 years, the spacing for my year end balance for year 10 and above is slightly off.  It's not a very noticeable difference, but it can hurt the program's readability when looking at investments for a longer time frame. I think the next time I do an assignment like this, I could also make use of some throw-try-catch statements to ensure that the correct input is keyed in.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  
  I have always struggled with loops!  It doesn't matter the programming language, loops have always been the hardest part of any coding process.  In this situation, I struggled a bit with my for loop for calculating interest.  What I have learned to do, is keep a notebook on hand!  Whenever I'm creating a loop, I'll write it down in my notebook and write down what changes are made during each iteration.  This really helped me stay focused, especially since the for loop I used to calculate interest had a SECOND for loop within it.  
  
  One of the sources I use to help me is a site a former teacher I had recomended, w3schools.com.  The site is good at refreshing my memory on previously learned aspects of coding.  I've also found apps like SoloLearn helpful to use alongside other learning sites like CodeAcademy.com

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  
  This project taught me so much on how classes and functions can work together to create a very minimal main function.  I can use this knowledge and skillset to further improve future projects or course work.  I've found that having different parts of the program seperated into many different functions helps significantly when it comes to debugging.  This is definately something I would carry on later on in future projects, as it would allow me to save time.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I had a lot of comments throughout my code that helped with the readability.  It allows anyone looking into my code to understand what each line does and how it affects any future changes.  The program is easy to maintain and adapt because it's built using several functions that work together in the final product.  You can easily make changes to one function and have it be reflected in the end result.  With the main function being minimal, and everything else being split up into smaller functions, this also allows debugging to be a much easier process.  Therefore, any changes made to the program can easily be narrowed down.
